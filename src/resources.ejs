<h2>Project 2025 & Fascism</h2>
<p>
Throughout the timeline, you'll find most things labelled "Project 2025" and a few labelled "Fascism." Although so much of Project 2025 is fascist in nature, it's necessary to leave the most terrifying events under "Fascism" for the purpose of filtering. The term "Fascism" is thrown around a lot, so here are some links that talk about the different types of government, including Fascism, Authoritarianism, and Totalitarianism. In short, all three are fascist in nature, but there are minor differences. Regardless of the term used, it is undeniable that the USA is losing its democracy and a psychopathic dictator is taking power.
